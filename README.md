Geppetto is a Slack bot for teams to easily interact with ChatGPT. It integrates with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 and DALL-E-3 models. This project is brought to you by [CoinFabrik](https://www.coinfabrik.com), a company specialized in cybersecurity and decentralized technologies. We recommend reading our [blog](https://www.coinfabrik.com/blog/) and following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coinfabrik) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coinfabrik).

## Features

1. **Interaction with ChatGPT-4:**
   - You can send direct messages to the application and receive responses from ChatGPT-4.
   - Each message generates a conversation thread, and the application uses the message history to formulate coherent responses.

2. **Image Generation with DALL-E-3:**
   - The application uses DALL-E-3 to generate an image based on the message.

## Usage Rules

- **Direct Messages:**
   - It is not necessary to mention the application with "@" in direct messages.
   - Each direct message generates a conversation thread.

- **Slack Channels:**
   - You must mention the application with "@" to interact in channels.

- **Allowed Users:**
   - Only authorized users can interact with the application. Set allowed users in [./config/allowed-slack-ids.json](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/geppetto/blob/main/config/allowed-slack-ids.json).
